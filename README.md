# Worked on the project Maksim Kolyada(DaZZeN-2)

The project implies a platform that provides data about films.

There is also authorization in the project, it was created using the firebase library, the project contains information about trending films, as well as a page with films that users have added to their favorites.

The settings page is also present, where users can change their nickname, mail, password if they forgot. And also in the project there is a change in the theme of the page, such as light or dark themes.

The project has a search string so that users can find the movie they are interested in, as well as filtering by the necessary criteria.

I would be grateful if you rate this project.
